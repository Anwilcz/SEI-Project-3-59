    description: "Take a leisurely walk along a nature path (and meet our friendly critters) to our outdoor yoga studio. Stretch, relax, and center yourself as you prepare to practice yoga while our friendly goats wander around - or even on - you! Soak in the joy of simplicity and happiness that goats can bring! At the end of class, sit peacefully and snuggle one of our adorable baby goats! Other things to note. Please plan to arrive a little early; gates open 15 minutes before class. Please dress for the farm setting and the weather. Campfire will be provided in the colder weather.",

  description: "Join me as we venture into the magical wizarding world of Harry Potter in London! We will journey through the city and learn the history of JK Rowling and Harry Potter in London. On this walking tour of London's streets we will watch clips from the movies while I regale you with behind-the-scenes stories of those locations as well as the history of JK Rowling's time in London. Our first stop will be the entrance to Diagon Alley, before we pop down to see the Ministry of Magic, and find out which Leaky Cauldron has the best tacos, as well as others I don't want to spoil here. I will also share some of the strangest, funniest non-HP facts I've learned about London along the way. We will finish at Borough Market, London's top street food destination, with King's Cross just a separate Tube ride away. PLEASE be aware the tour is offered in English only, and it is largely story-based, so a better-than-basic conversational grasp of English is essential.",
