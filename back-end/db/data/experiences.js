Our first stop will be the entrance to Diagon Alley, before we pop down to see the Ministry of Magic, and find out which Leaky Cauldron has the best tacos, as well as others I don\'t want to spoil here. I will also share some of the strangest, funniest non-HP facts I\'ve learned about London along the way. We will finish at Borough Market, London\'s top street food destination, with King\'s Cross just a separate Tube ride away.

You\'ll be taken within the shell of a church destroyed in the Blitz, and be led into the park which displays one of the most touching memorials to self sacrifice you could possibly imagine. The walk lasts 1.5 hours and will leave a lasting impression of a different side to London\'s deep and extraordinary history.

We will walk up the lane and through the fields, going at the ponies pace and allowing them to browse on the plants in the hedgerows. We’ll also collect cuttings and weeds to take back with us for their pony friends (in season only).  You will learn about wild plants and trees and how they benefit the ponies diet, plus more about pony care and behaviour. We will finish the walk back at the pony field where you will brush their coats and manes and tails, before turning them back out to the field. We serve a cold drink and slice of cake for you to enjoy whilst watching the ponies graze surrounded by beautiful scenery. You will be able to really get to know the ponies as individuals and see their different characters and personalities. With a calm and gentle approach, it won’t take long before they are queueing up for a scratch from you. Other things to note: This is a leisurely walk that is perfect for animal lovers. If you cannot see a date or time that suits you, please contact me to request another date. All children must be accompanied by an adult. No open toed shoes or sandals. The ponies cannot be ridden, this is for walking and grooming only. Only one child under the age of 6 per group for safety.",

    description: "Forest Bathing (Shinrin-Yoku) is a traditional Japanese awareness meditation, proven to be a profound antidote to anxiety, depression, fear and tension. You will be taken upon a simple forest walk, whereupon your guide, Helena, will facilitate and enable a sensual immersive experience, whereby the forest languages of renewal, growth, change and impermanence will become your experiential second nature. You will develop a sense of inner peace and stillness that will be supported and encouraged by nature's living, ever-changing process. Absolutely no experience necessary. The requirements are a willingness to let go of your troubles, fears, worries and anxieties. Other things to note: Wear warmer clothes than usual as we will spend time being still in the woods and in the shade of the forest canope. You may also wish to bring something to sit on during sit spot practice.",

    description: "Join me on a walk to Richmond where I show you how to take beautiful pictures of these animals while respecting their territory. I will tell you information about the deers' behavior, habitat and many interesting facts. I will also try to answer as many questions as possible. All health and safety instructions will be given at the beginning of our walk. Recommended gear: - Any type of camera - Telephoto lens - spare battery - Pastel color, darker tone of clothes We will meet at the end of Cambrian Road where there is a gate leading into the park. From there on we will visit the locations where the deer are most frequently seen. Even though these animals got used to being close to human activity I can not guarantee the number of deer we will see on our tour through the park. This experience fits everyone who visits London or those who live here but want to see its wildlife from a different perspective with the lead of someone who has years of experience doing it. Other things to note: To approach these animals safely, we have to pay attention to them and have to accept that even though they meet people every day, they are still wild animals so sometimes they can be unpredictable. Silence and slow, cautious movement are necessary.",

    description: "You'll be greeted personally by a member of the Huckleberry Woods team who will take you to meet the pigs and help you choose the perfect pig for you to walk and may recommend a particular pig. There'll be an introduction on how to walk your piggy to maximise enjoyment for both you and the piggy and then off you go. Please note, the pigs are now 4 years old, past the tiny piglet stage. They're about the size of a Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Your walk will be accompanied by an experienced and knowledgeable piggy handler and enthusiast who will be delighted to share all sorts of piggy facts and stories with you. You'll have plenty of opportunity to stroke the piggies, take photos and ask questions during your walk. You can stop to greet the miniature donkeys, Teddy Bear sheep, alpacas, ducks, turkeys and chickens as you go. The pigs go at their own pace, they may amble about slowly or be feeling a bit more energetic - it all depends on the piggy on the day and how much fruit there is on the ground for them to graze. At the end of the walk we head back to the piggy's house for a well earned rest and a hand wash. Length of walk is around 20 minutes before the pigs head home. Please note piggy walks are for one person (aged 4 years and above) only - it's not possible to share a piggy. You're welcome to stay and see the other miniature animals after your experience",
