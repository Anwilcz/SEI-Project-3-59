    description: 'Take a leisurely walk along a nature path (and meet our friendly critters) to our outdoor yoga studio. Stretch, relax, and center yourself as you prepare to practice yoga while our friendly goats wander around - or even on - you! Soak in the joy of simplicity and happiness that goats can bring! At the end of class, sit peacefully and snuggle one of our adorable baby goats! Other things to note. Please plan to arrive a little early; gates open 15 minutes before class. Please dress for the farm setting and the weather. Campfire will be provided in the colder weather.',

    description: 'Walking through the ancient streets of London, you'll learn what lies beneath your feet, from 14th century Black Death victims to a long lost Roman Ampitheatre. Standing by some of the most foreboding locations in the city, I'll tell you about the gruesome executions which took place here, and the partying and revelry which accompanied them! You'll be taken within the shell of a church destroyed in the Blitz, and be led into the park which displays one of the most touching memorials to self sacrifice you could possibly imagine. The walk lasts 1.5 hours and will leave a lasting impression of a different side to London's deep and extraordinary history. Other things to note: Your guide (Matt) will be easily identifiable with a flag and friendly smile. There are no toilet or refreshment breaks during the tour, so please be prepared. Occasionally my friend Jess will guide.',
