On this walking tour of London\'s streets we will watch clips from the movies while I regale you with behind-the-scenes stories of those locations as well as the history of JK Rowling\'s time in London. Our first stop will be the entrance to Diagon Alley, before we pop down to see the Ministry of Magic, and find out which Leaky Cauldron has the best tacos, as well as others I don\'t want to spoil here. I will also share some of the strangest, funniest non-HP facts I\'ve learned about London along the way. We will finish at Borough Market, London\'s top street food destination, with King\'s Cross just a separate Tube ride away. PLEASE be aware the tour is offered in English only, and it is largely story-based, so a better-than-basic conversational grasp of English is essential.',

    description: 'Walking through the ancient streets of London, you\'ll learn what lies beneath your feet, from 14th century Black Death victims to a long lost Roman Ampitheatre. Standing by some of the most foreboding locations in the city, I\'ll tell you about the gruesome executions which took place here, and the partying and revelry which accompanied them! You\'ll be taken within the shell of a church destroyed in the Blitz, and be led into the park which displays one of the most touching memorials to self sacrifice you could possibly imagine. The walk lasts 1.5 hours and will leave a lasting impression of a different side to London\'s deep and extraordinary history. Other things to note: Your guide (Matt) will be easily identifiable with a flag and friendly smile. There are no toilet or refreshment breaks during the tour, so please be prepared. Occasionally my friend Jess will guide.',

    description: "Star the pony and I will meet you at our meeting point where we will carry out introductions and cover safety tips, before we head off for the walk. We will walk up the lane and through the fields, going at the ponies pace and allowing them to browse on the plants in the hedgerows. We’ll also collect cuttings and weeds to take back with us for their pony friends (in season only).  You will learn about wild plants and trees and how they benefit the ponies diet, plus more about pony care and behaviour. We will finish the walk back at the pony field where you will brush their coats and manes and tails, before turning them back out to the field. We serve a cold drink and slice of cake for you to enjoy whilst watching the ponies graze surrounded by beautiful scenery. You will be able to really get to know the ponies as individuals and see their different characters and personalities. With a calm and gentle approach, it won’t take long before they are queueing up for a scratch from you. Other things to note: This is a leisurely walk that is perfect for animal lovers. If you cannot see a date or time that suits you, please contact me to request another date. All children must be accompanied by an adult. No open toed shoes or sandals. The ponies cannot be ridden, this is for walking and grooming only. Only one child under the age of 6 per group for safety.",

    description: "I will take you off onto the local trails for a relaxed and sociable run. This is not about pace or distance, but about enjoying the beauty of the local countryside and sights. Experience will last approx 1-1.5 hours. We will go at your pace and take as many stops/rest breaks as needed. This is your experience after all. Provided you can comfortably complete a 5k run, you will be just fine. I will meet you at Shalford Park by the toilet building. There is parking available here or the park is approx 10-15 minute walk from central Guildford. Please dress for the expected weather i.e. jacket if raining. During late autumn/winter/early spring, the trails can become quite muddy, so don't be surprised if your shoes come back a little dirty!",

    description: "Forest Bathing (Shinrin-Yoku) is a traditional Japanese awareness meditation, proven to be a profound antidote to anxiety, depression, fear and tension. You will be taken upon a simple forest walk, whereupon your guide, Helena, will facilitate and enable a sensual immersive experience, whereby the forest languages of renewal, growth, change and impermanence will become your experiential second nature. You will develop a sense of inner peace and stillness that will be supported and encouraged by nature's living, ever-changing process. Absolutely no experience necessary. The requirements are a willingness to let go of your troubles, fears, worries and anxieties. Other things to note: Wear warmer clothes than usual as we will spend time being still in the woods and in the shade of the forest canope. You may also wish to bring something to sit on during sit spot practice.",

    description: "Join me on a walk to Richmond where I show you how to take beautiful pictures of these animals while respecting their territory. I will tell you information about the deers' behavior, habitat and many interesting facts. I will also try to answer as many questions as possible. All health and safety instructions will be given at the beginning of our walk. Recommended gear: - Any type of camera - Telephoto lens - spare battery - Pastel color, darker tone of clothes We will meet at the end of Cambrian Road where there is a gate leading into the park. From there on we will visit the locations where the deer are most frequently seen. Even though these animals got used to being close to human activity I can not guarantee the number of deer we will see on our tour through the park. This experience fits everyone who visits London or those who live here but want to see its wildlife from a different perspective with the lead of someone who has years of experience doing it. Other things to note: To approach these animals safely, we have to pay attention to them and have to accept that even though they meet people every day, they are still wild animals so sometimes they can be unpredictable. Silence and slow, cautious movement are necessary.",

    description: "You'll be greeted personally by a member of the Huckleberry Woods team who will take you to meet the pigs and help you choose the perfect pig for you to walk and may recommend a particular pig. There'll be an introduction on how to walk your piggy to maximise enjoyment for both you and the piggy and then off you go. Please note, the pigs are now 4 years old, past the tiny piglet stage. They're about the size of a Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Your walk will be accompanied by an experienced and knowledgeable piggy handler and enthusiast who will be delighted to share all sorts of piggy facts and stories with you. You'll have plenty of opportunity to stroke the piggies, take photos and ask questions during your walk. You can stop to greet the miniature donkeys, Teddy Bear sheep, alpacas, ducks, turkeys and chickens as you go. The pigs go at their own pace, they may amble about slowly or be feeling a bit more energetic - it all depends on the piggy on the day and how much fruit there is on the ground for them to graze. At the end of the walk we head back to the piggy's house for a well earned rest and a hand wash. Length of walk is around 20 minutes before the pigs head home. Please note piggy walks are for one person (aged 4 years and above) only - it's not possible to share a piggy. You're welcome to stay and see the other miniature animals after your experience",

We ensure that social distancing is adhered to at all times and equipment is fully sanitised. Come and learn a new skill and see the world in a different way! You will come and meet me in the park with all the kit that you need for the activity. I will go through everything, ensuring you know how to use it. From there we will go through some simple paddling techniques as well as running through safety measures, so that you know what you\'re doing. We will go to explore the local area, seeing the sights and building your confidence as we go! If you don\'t see a day/time when you can to make, send me a message and we can schedule in something to suit you. Don\'t worry if you\'re a newbie, we keep the groups to a manageable size. If you\'re looking for something a bit more adventurous do get in touch and I can put together a bespoke package for you! I look forward to welcoming you on board.

I will make sure that you don\'t get lost and that you will experience the best tracks this area has to offer. The start and finishing point it\'s at the Hurtwood (Holmbury Hill) Car Park. We will go at a pace decided by you and take multiple stops to hydrate and take some snacks to keep us full of energy! Other things to note: I can provide rental bicycles for £50 each with two days notice. If there\'s a chance for rain, please bring spare clothing for after the ride and a towel. A backpack with some spares, like inner tubes would be a good addition. Have a light, carbs rich breakfast like porridge or banana smoothie!',

    description: 'This walk follows government guidelines on covid protection to ensure guest safety. Fantastic experience. Learnt so much about what is hiding in plain sight! Mark, Discover Hidden Sites Guest I will take you on an interactive walk through beautiful hidden gardens very near the usual tourist sites but rarely visited by most tourists. Firstly we will hear about the sensational story of 19-year-old Katherine Howard, Henry VIII\'s fifth wife who was executed for adultery. Discover scandals and court plots that make Game of Thrones seem dull! Secondly, we will learn about Jonathan Tyers `The Maker of Dreams and owner of the Vegas and Disney of the 18th century. Discover how Jonathan became wealthy and inspired generations of wealth creators! Thirdly, we\'ll see the home of the suffragist Millicent Fawcett, whose house entertained 19th century feminists, bohemians, and radicals. Discover how Millicent changed the world! Finally we will look at how the stories of Katherine, Jonathan and Millicent are all about your values and how you choose to interpret their time on earth! Other things to note This is a gentle great for groups and solo travellers walk that will take place in all types of weather. The last stop is Fentiman Park, which is minutes away from the Vauxhall underground, bus, and railway stations. I will provide hand sanitiser.',

    description: 'Players assume the role of secret agents whose mission is to prevent an imminent heist in the heart of London. As they follow the criminals\' trail in the streets, they get to solve a number of puzzles and mental challenges that are dispersed in the game area. These puzzles encourage team spirit and are great fun! Groups split in small teams of 2-4 players each. Teams interact with their environment and compete against each other for points. They can tackle challenges in any order they choose. This allows them to create their unique strategies and ensures they are well-dispersed over the game area. The game is played in the streets and alleys in the vicinity of St Paul\'s. Through special iPad tablets handed out to each team, the game uses latest digital technology in a most intuitive way that engages even those who are uncomfortable with mainstream mobile applications: Interactive maps guide the teams to various locations of interest where they solve challenges. With the help of these maps, each team can see the position of all other teams in real time.Several of the challenges contain seamless augmented reality features and image recognition on real world objects or landmarks. This adds another dimension to the games and makes them very entertaining.',

    description: 'Drag yourself around the streets of drags to discover the history of Voho, London’s oldest gaybourhood with a reputation for fantastical hedonism that’s lasted for over 200 years. On this unique walk, you’ll solve clue-after-clue to follow a trail discovering hidden gems of history. Narrated by the fabulous Lady Lambeth, you’ll get the inside scoop on lesbians abseiling into parliament and what connects Princess Diana, Freddie Mercury and the country’s most iconic drag bar. This experience is part scavenger hunt part history tour, and is completely self-guided using your mobile phone. We\'ll send clues to you directly, you use your powers of observation to find the answer and as you solve one clue we\'ll reveal directions for the next. You can play with friends in groups of up to 6. The walk will end at the world-famous Royal Vauxhall Tavern, where you can enjoy a drink at the iconic venue that\'s been graced by Princess Diana, Freddie Mercury and many more.',

Then we will head Parliament Square to see Big Ben (sadly covered up) & Westminster Abbey. Sights we will see along the way include Trafalgar Square, Nelson\'s Column, Horse Guards, Downing Street, Parliament Square, Westminster Abbey & the Houses of Parliament. I will guide you on an exploration of one of London\'s most loved areas : Westminster. It is the oldest part of London with buildings that are 1000 years old. Early Kings and Queens lived, got married and were buried in this part of London. There are Palaces and Parks galore here. This area houses the UK\'s famous Houses of Parliament (Westminster Palace) We will walk around this area and tell you the history, the fun facts and figures and also how the UK evolved from Roman to Medieval times to the modern day London. After the walking tour we then head to the Bunker where Churchill ran Britain\'s efforts during WW2 :) Entrance to Churchill\'s War Rooms is included',
