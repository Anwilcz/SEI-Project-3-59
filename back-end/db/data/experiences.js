On this walking tour of London\'s streets we will watch clips from the movies while I regale you with behind-the-scenes stories of those locations as well as the history of JK Rowling\'s time in London. Our first stop will be the entrance to Diagon Alley, before we pop down to see the Ministry of Magic, and find out which Leaky Cauldron has the best tacos, as well as others I don\'t want to spoil here. I will also share some of the strangest, funniest non-HP facts I\'ve learned about London along the way. We will finish at Borough Market, London\'s top street food destination, with King\'s Cross just a separate Tube ride away. PLEASE be aware the tour is offered in English only, and it is largely story-based, so a better-than-basic conversational grasp of English is essential.',

    description: 'Walking through the ancient streets of London, you\'ll learn what lies beneath your feet, from 14th century Black Death victims to a long lost Roman Ampitheatre. Standing by some of the most foreboding locations in the city, I\'ll tell you about the gruesome executions which took place here, and the partying and revelry which accompanied them! You\'ll be taken within the shell of a church destroyed in the Blitz, and be led into the park which displays one of the most touching memorials to self sacrifice you could possibly imagine. The walk lasts 1.5 hours and will leave a lasting impression of a different side to London\'s deep and extraordinary history. Other things to note: Your guide (Matt) will be easily identifiable with a flag and friendly smile. There are no toilet or refreshment breaks during the tour, so please be prepared. Occasionally my friend Jess will guide.',

    description: "Star the pony and I will meet you at our meeting point where we will carry out introductions and cover safety tips, before we head off for the walk. We will walk up the lane and through the fields, going at the ponies pace and allowing them to browse on the plants in the hedgerows. We’ll also collect cuttings and weeds to take back with us for their pony friends (in season only).  You will learn about wild plants and trees and how they benefit the ponies diet, plus more about pony care and behaviour. We will finish the walk back at the pony field where you will brush their coats and manes and tails, before turning them back out to the field. We serve a cold drink and slice of cake for you to enjoy whilst watching the ponies graze surrounded by beautiful scenery. You will be able to really get to know the ponies as individuals and see their different characters and personalities. With a calm and gentle approach, it won’t take long before they are queueing up for a scratch from you. Other things to note: This is a leisurely walk that is perfect for animal lovers. If you cannot see a date or time that suits you, please contact me to request another date. All children must be accompanied by an adult. No open toed shoes or sandals. The ponies cannot be ridden, this is for walking and grooming only. Only one child under the age of 6 per group for safety.",

Experience will last approx 1-1.5 hours. We will go at your pace and take as many stops/rest breaks as needed. This is your experience after all. Provided you can comfortably complete a 5k run, you will be just fine. I will meet you at Shalford Park by the toilet building. There is parking available here or the park is approx 10-15 minute walk from central Guildford. Please dress for the expected weather i.e. jacket if raining. During late autumn/winter/early spring, the trails can become quite muddy, so don't be surprised if your shoes come back a little dirty!",

    description: "Forest Bathing (Shinrin-Yoku) is a traditional Japanese awareness meditation, proven to be a profound antidote to anxiety, depression, fear and tension. You will be taken upon a simple forest walk, whereupon your guide, Helena, will facilitate and enable a sensual immersive experience, whereby the forest languages of renewal, growth, change and impermanence will become your experiential second nature. You will develop a sense of inner peace and stillness that will be supported and encouraged by nature's living, ever-changing process. Absolutely no experience necessary. The requirements are a willingness to let go of your troubles, fears, worries and anxieties. Other things to note: Wear warmer clothes than usual as we will spend time being still in the woods and in the shade of the forest canope. You may also wish to bring something to sit on during sit spot practice.",

    description: "Join me on a walk to Richmond where I show you how to take beautiful pictures of these animals while respecting their territory. I will tell you information about the deers' behavior, habitat and many interesting facts. I will also try to answer as many questions as possible. All health and safety instructions will be given at the beginning of our walk. Recommended gear: - Any type of camera - Telephoto lens - spare battery - Pastel color, darker tone of clothes We will meet at the end of Cambrian Road where there is a gate leading into the park. From there on we will visit the locations where the deer are most frequently seen. Even though these animals got used to being close to human activity I can not guarantee the number of deer we will see on our tour through the park. This experience fits everyone who visits London or those who live here but want to see its wildlife from a different perspective with the lead of someone who has years of experience doing it. Other things to note: To approach these animals safely, we have to pay attention to them and have to accept that even though they meet people every day, they are still wild animals so sometimes they can be unpredictable. Silence and slow, cautious movement are necessary.",

    description: "You'll be greeted personally by a member of the Huckleberry Woods team who will take you to meet the pigs and help you choose the perfect pig for you to walk and may recommend a particular pig. There'll be an introduction on how to walk your piggy to maximise enjoyment for both you and the piggy and then off you go. Please note, the pigs are now 4 years old, past the tiny piglet stage. They're about the size of a Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Your walk will be accompanied by an experienced and knowledgeable piggy handler and enthusiast who will be delighted to share all sorts of piggy facts and stories with you. You'll have plenty of opportunity to stroke the piggies, take photos and ask questions during your walk. You can stop to greet the miniature donkeys, Teddy Bear sheep, alpacas, ducks, turkeys and chickens as you go. The pigs go at their own pace, they may amble about slowly or be feeling a bit more energetic - it all depends on the piggy on the day and how much fruit there is on the ground for them to graze. At the end of the walk we head back to the piggy's house for a well earned rest and a hand wash. Length of walk is around 20 minutes before the pigs head home. Please note piggy walks are for one person (aged 4 years and above) only - it's not possible to share a piggy. You're welcome to stay and see the other miniature animals after your experience",

We ensure that social distancing is adhered to at all times and equipment is fully sanitised. Come and learn a new skill and see the world in a different way! You will come and meet me in the park with all the kit that you need for the activity. I will go through everything, ensuring you know how to use it. From there we will go through some simple paddling techniques as well as running through safety measures, so that you know what you\'re doing. We will go to explore the local area, seeing the sights and building your confidence as we go! If you don\'t see a day/time when you can to make, send me a message and we can schedule in something to suit you. Don\'t worry if you\'re a newbie, we keep the groups to a manageable size. If you\'re looking for something a bit more adventurous do get in touch and I can put together a bespoke package for you! I look forward to welcoming you on board.

I will make sure that you don\'t get lost and that you will experience the best tracks this area has to offer. The start and finishing point it\'s at the Hurtwood (Holmbury Hill) Car Park. We will go at a pace decided by you and take multiple stops to hydrate and take some snacks to keep us full of energy! Other things to note: I can provide rental bicycles for £50 each with two days notice. If there\'s a chance for rain, please bring spare clothing for after the ride and a towel.

    description: 'Are you ready to enter a peaceful world of lush greens and serenity? Only a short distance away from the busy centre of London a different world is waiting for you. I will welcome you at my 100 year old house before I provide you with a bicycle and we will go for a relaxed ride along a historic river, crossing beautiful parks along the way, completely traffic free. Find out how London was formed of little villages growing together and how this rural charm can still be experienced today. I will show you why this river, where people have been living and working for centuries, is still one of London\'s best kept secrets. We will cycle through one of South London\'s most historical area, where once a church stood as big as Westminster Abbey and a King was crowned. We will see London\'s only still functioning waterwheel set in a market next to the river and stop for drinks/food at an ancient pub at the ponds of a picturesque English village. I have designed this trip to be away from traffic so you can focus on the charming scenery of this fascinating part of London.Other things to note Contact me for dates not available on my calendar. The route is flat and should not cause difficulties for a healthy person that knows how to ride a bike.The overall distance is about 12 miles/20 km. For more information see Londoncycletours.com',

    description: 'I will meet my guests at the riding school where our driving horses are. I will give them a safety briefing. Then we will bring our lovely Haflinger, Bruce, in from the field and give him his hay and a brush. Guests will learn how to harness the horse, and put him into the carriage. We will put on hi-vis jackets. Guests will sit up at the front of the carriage with me, and with their own set of reins so they learn to control the horse (a bit like dual-control in a car). We will drive round the village of Furneux Pelham at a walk and trot, for forty minutes, passing the church, the school, the old forge, the pub, and will arrive back at the Riding School. We will unharness the horse, give him a nice feed and put him back in his field. We will enjoy hot and cold drinks and snacks before we head home. The whole experience will take two hours. Other things to note: There are around 30 ponies and horses, two friendly dogs, several sheep and three cats at the riding school. We provide optional riding hats (which we recommend). It is best to be quite quiet around horses. We make every effort to make you safe but please be aware Carriage-Driving is a risk sport.',
