Our first stop will be the entrance to Diagon Alley, before we pop down to see the Ministry of Magic, and find out which Leaky Cauldron has the best tacos, as well as others I don\'t want to spoil here. I will also share some of the strangest, funniest non-HP facts I\'ve learned about London along the way. We will finish at Borough Market, London\'s top street food destination, with King\'s Cross just a separate Tube ride away.

You\'ll be taken within the shell of a church destroyed in the Blitz, and be led into the park which displays one of the most touching memorials to self sacrifice you could possibly imagine. The walk lasts 1.5 hours and will leave a lasting impression of a different side to London\'s deep and extraordinary history.
