## Overview

The project aim was to build a full-stack application including own backend and frontend setup by using Express API to serve data from the Mongo database and render information in the browser by JavaScript React. The application was inspired by the Airbnb experience that operates the marketplace for listed activities. The project includes various filters that allow clipping data to the area of interest of potential customers, user authentication and post features for profile and custom experience page. Registered users can add their own experience through a multi field form request and favourite listings that already exist in the database.
